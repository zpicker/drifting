# Drifting
> A visual effects program by Zachary Picker
> zacpicker.com

'Drifting' is a visual effects program, intended for use as an art installation and as visuals to accompany live music. Low-pixel cityscapes are generated in real-time, transitioning through daytime, sunset, night, and sunrise again. As the work progresses, transformative effects are iteratively applied, forming a dreamlike narrative as the city ebbs and flows through periods of calm and periods of intense, abstracted imagery. It was most recently performed as accompaniment to an experimental electronic music set by Ayala for Concrete Dreams at Mothership Studios.

This project is also 50% an excuse for me to get more comfortable both with Github and with creating fully realized programs with Python. It's very much just a passion project and a bit of fun-- I don't intend on managing this and keeping it updated and properly tested.

Feel free to download it and enjoy it-- I recommend putting on some good ambient electronic music, or maybe something psychedelic. If you want to use it for something, just shoot me an email and give me credit (or even, some money, if you're feeling generous!).

## Getting it going

I've frozen the program into a .exe file, but it's rather large at the moment, so I'll figure out what to do with that. I've only tested it on my win10 system, but I should be able to make an osx or linux application at some point.

Otherwise, drifting is written in python, so you can just run the code yourself. You'll need the opencv and numpy packages installed:
```sh
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
```
I probably won't be able to help you much with troubleshooting if things go wrong... you're on your own!

## Instructions and explanations

The program displays generated cityscapes for a given period of time, with different kind of effects being applied to the image. Here's an explanation of the menu options:
